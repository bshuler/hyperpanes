# The `.hyperpanes` workspace format — design & options

**Status:** design doc / decision aid for the maintainer. **No code is changed by this
document.** It (1) documents the *current* workspace-file schema and how it is opened and
saved, (2) lays out three options for a dedicated `.hyperpanes` extension with tradeoffs and
a recommendation, (3) gives the Windows file-association snippet so a double-clicked
workspace opens in the app, and (4) lists the exact implementation touch-points for whichever
option is chosen.

The app round-trips workspaces as plain **JSON**. Option (b) below — the versioned container
(`{"format": "hyperpanes", "version": 1, "workspace": {…}}`) — has since **shipped**: the
writer emits the envelope and the reader accepts both it and a bare `WorkspaceFile` object
(legacy, treated as "version 0"). Sections 2-3 are preserved as the decision record; read
them as history, not as a description of today's reader. Everything below is grounded in the
existing port:

- schema: [`rs/crates/core/src/workspace/model.rs`](../rs/crates/core/src/workspace/model.rs)
- read/write/normalise: [`rs/crates/core/src/workspace/io.rs`](../rs/crates/core/src/workspace/io.rs)
- launch resolution: [`rs/crates/core/src/workspace/launch.rs`](../rs/crates/core/src/workspace/launch.rs)
- CLI positional capture: [`rs/crates/core/src/cli/parse.rs`](../rs/crates/core/src/cli/parse.rs)
- installer: [`rs/packaging/installer.nsi`](../rs/packaging/installer.nsi)

## 1. Current schema

The on-disk file is a single JSON object deserialized into `WorkspaceFile`. Panes can be
described at **any** of three nesting levels — top-level `panes`, a list of `groups` (tabs),
or a list of `windows` (each with its own tabs) — and the loader normalises whichever is
present into a flat window list (precedence `windows` → `groups` → `panes`, see
`windows_of` in `io.rs`).

### `WorkspaceFile` (top level)

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name`    | `string?`           | workspace name; also the default window/tab title |
| `layout`  | `string?`           | layout id for the legacy single-tab shape (e.g. `main-stack`, `grid`, `columns`) |
| `panes`   | `PaneSpec[]?`       | top-level panes → one window, one tab |
| `groups`  | `GroupSpec[]?`      | tabs → one window of tabs |
| `active`  | `number?` (u32)     | active tab index when using `groups` |
| `windows` | `WindowSpec[]?`     | full multi-window shape |

### `WindowSpec`

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title`  | `string?`        | window title |
| `active` | `number?` (u32)  | active tab index |
| `bounds` | `WindowBounds?`  | saved OS-window geometry |
| `groups` | `GroupSpec[]`    | tabs (required array; a window with none is dropped on load) |

### `WindowBounds`

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `x`, `y`            | `number?` (i64) | top-left position (may be negative) |
| `width`, `height`  | `number?` (i64) | size |
| `maximized`        | `bool?`         | restore maximized |
| `fullscreen`       | `bool?`         | restore OS fullscreen |

### `GroupSpec` (a tab)

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `title`        | `string?`       | tab title |
| `layout`       | `string?`       | tab layout id |
| `panes`        | `PaneSpec[]`    | the tab's panes (required array) |
| `sizes`        | `number[]?`     | per-slot split fractions (sum → 1; length matches `panes`) |
| `mainFraction` | `number?` (f64) | main-stack split fraction (0 < f < 1) |
| `focused`      | `number?` (u32) | index of the focused pane (default 0) |
| `zoomed`       | `number?` (u32) | index of the maximized pane (default: none) |

### `PaneSpec`

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `label`    | `string?`              | pane label (defaults to the command's first token) |
| `color`    | `string?`              | accent color, e.g. `#e5484d` |
| `command`  | `string?`              | shell command line to run |
| `args`     | `string[]?`            | literal argv for a direct (no-shell) spawn with `command` |
| `cwd`      | `string?`              | working directory (relative cwds resolved on load — see below) |
| `shell`    | `string?`              | shell override (e.g. `pwsh`) |
| `fontSize` | `number?` (u32)        | per-pane font size |
| `meta`     | `{string:string}?`     | free-form per-pane metadata (sorted keys; used by agent orchestration / ambient AI) |
| `uid`      | `string?`              | the pane's live session id at save time — the **re-attach key** (see below). Always optional |
| `talk`     | `boolean?`             | speak new Claude assistant replies aloud (recorded only when on) |

#### `uid` — the re-attach key, and why it is always optional

`uid` records the durable session id the pane was running under when the file was written
(`pane-<uuid>` against the session daemon, `s<N>` in-process). On load, each pane is decided
**independently** by `SessionManager::pane_load`: if the recorded uid still names a *live*
daemon session, that pane **re-attaches** to it; otherwise the pane **spawns fresh** from its
`command`/`args`/`shell`, under a newly minted uid. This is what lets a saved workspace be
re-opened without duplicating terminals that are still running.

It is written by the relaunch ("last session") snapshot, and — since the workspace-library
milestone — by *Save workspace*, *Save workspace as…*, and by the member workspaces a set
writes.

**Compatibility runs both ways, and both directions are covered by tests**
(`rs/crates/core/tests/workspace_uid_compat.rs`):

- **Old file, new build.** A workspace written before `uid` existed simply has no `uid` on any
  pane. Every pane is a `Spawn` — i.e. the exact pre-`uid` behaviour — so hand-authored launch
  templates keep working unchanged. There is nothing to migrate.
- **New file, old build.** No struct in `workspace/` uses `deny_unknown_fields`, so a build
  that predates the field parses a `uid`-bearing file and ignores the extra key.
- **Per pane, not per file.** A file may carry a `uid` on some panes and not others; each is
  decided on its own.

Because `uid` names a *runtime* session, it is not meaningful to hand-write and is safe to
delete from a file by hand — doing so just forces a fresh spawn.

### Serialization rules (parity contract — `model.rs`)

These are guaranteed by the serde model and exercised by its round-trip tests:

- **camelCase** JSON field names (`fontSize`, `mainFraction`) via `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`.
- **Unset optionals are omitted, never written as `null`** (`skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`); downstream is strict.
- **Field/`meta`-key order is canonical** — declaration order for fields, sorted keys for `meta` (it's a `BTreeMap`) — so a canonically-ordered file round-trips **byte-identically** through 2-space pretty printing (the same as `JSON.stringify(x, null, 2)`).

### Example

```json
{
  "name": "dev",
  "layout": "main-stack",
  "panes": [
    {
      "label": "server",
      "color": "#e5484d",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "cwd": "/work",
      "shell": "pwsh",
      "fontSize": 14
    },
    { "command": "tail -f log" }
  ]
}
```

### Workspace **sets** (`sets/*.json`)

A *set* is a named collection of workspaces opened as a batch. It lives beside the library in
the app's data directory (`sets/` alongside `workspaces/`) and uses its own envelope, mirroring
the workspace one:

```json
{
  "format": "hyperpanes-set",
  "version": 1,
  "set": {
    "name": "Morning Routine",
    "members": [
      { "path": "workspaces/morning-routine-1.hyperpanes", "name": "editor" },
      { "path": "workspaces/morning-routine-2.hyperpanes" }
    ]
  }
}
```

| JSON field | Rust type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name`    | `string`       | the set's display name |
| `members` | `SetMember[]`  | the workspaces to open, in order |

`SetMember` is `{ "path": string, "name": string? }`. A relative `path` is resolved against the
**set file's own directory**, so a `sets/` + `workspaces/` pair is relocatable as a unit. Saving
a set writes one member workspace per non-empty tab (a 0-pane tab is never a member) and then
the index; opening one loads every member as a tab, each pane taking the same
re-attach-or-spawn decision described above. Schema: `rs/crates/core/src/workspace/sets.rs`.

## 2. How a workspace is opened and saved today

**Open (launch / CLI).** `launch.rs` resolves what to load, in precedence order:

1. inline `-c …` flags assembled into a `WorkspaceFile` (`parse_cli` → `ParsedCli.workspace`);
2. a **positional `.json` path** (`ParsedCli.json_path` → `io::read_workspace`);
3. the last session at `last-workspace.json` (only in `resolve_launch_workspace`, not in the CLI-only `resolve_cli_workspace`).

The positional path is captured in `parse.rs` only when the argument **(case-insensitively) ends in `.json` *and* the file exists**, then resolved to an absolute path (`parse.rs` lines ~319-326). `read_workspace` reads the file, `serde_json::from_str`s it into `WorkspaceFile`, rejects a contentless file (`has_panes`), and resolves relative pane `cwd`s against the file's own directory.

**Open (GUI / double-click + drag).** The native GUI seeds from argv at startup (`-c …` or a `.json` positional → `load_workspace`); a bare `hyperpanes` with no args stays an empty shell pane (`resolve_cli_workspace` intentionally skips the last-session fallback). So a double-clicked file reaches the app as `argv[1]` and flows through the same positional-path capture.

**Save.** `io::write_workspace` serializes pretty (2-space) and writes the file; `windows_of` normalises any in-memory `WorkspaceFile` into the flat window list the launcher seeds from. Session auto-save targets `last-workspace.json`.

**Takeaway:** the *only* thing tying a file to the app is the **`.json` suffix check in `parse.rs`** (and the equivalent check in the GUI argv bootstrap). There is no content sniffing, no magic header, and no version field. Any `.hyperpanes` story has to start there. *(Historical: the envelope of option (b) has since shipped, so the reader does now sniff `format`/`version` — while still accepting a bare object.)*

---

## 3. Options for a dedicated `.hyperpanes` extension

### (a) Rename-only alias — accept `.hyperpanes` as JSON

Treat `.hyperpanes` as a second accepted suffix for the *exact same* JSON payload. No schema
change: the file is still a `WorkspaceFile` object; only the extension allow-list widens.

- **Pros:** smallest possible change (one extension check in `parse.rs` + the GUI bootstrap, plus the installer association); existing `.json` files keep working; nothing to migrate.
- **Cons:** no version marker, so a future breaking schema change still can't be detected or migrated cleanly; the extension is purely cosmetic; a `.hyperpanes` file and a `.json` file are indistinguishable by content (no magic header), so misnamed files can't be diagnosed.

### (b) Versioned container — **RECOMMENDED**

Wrap the existing payload in a thin envelope with a self-identifying header and a schema version:

```json
{
  "format": "hyperpanes",
  "version": 1,
  "workspace": {
    "name": "dev",
    "panes": [ { "command": "npm run dev" } ]
  }
}
```

(Or inline the payload fields alongside `format`/`version` — a flattened envelope — if you
prefer fewer levels of nesting. Either way the discriminators are `format` + `version`.)

- **Pros:** a **magic header** (`"format": "hyperpanes"`) lets the loader positively identify a workspace and reject look-alikes with a clear error; the **`version`** integer is the hook for real migrations (load v1, upgrade in memory, save v2) without guessing; still plain UTF-8 JSON — hand-editable, diff-friendly, copy-pasteable; can be introduced **backward-compatibly** by having the reader accept *both* a bare `WorkspaceFile` (legacy `.json`, treated as "version 0") and the wrapped form, and having the writer emit the wrapped form for `.hyperpanes`.
- **Cons:** slightly more code than (a) — a small envelope type plus a branch in the reader/writer; two accepted on-disk shapes during the compatibility window; the byte-identical round-trip contract has to be re-stated for the envelope (trivial, since it's still serde + 2-space pretty).

### (c) Binary capsule — **REJECTED**

A packed binary file (e.g. length-prefixed header + bincode/MessagePack/compressed blob).

- **Pros:** marginally smaller/faster to parse at very large sizes.
- **Cons:** **not human-editable**, not diffable, not pasteable into an issue or a chat; needs a custom tool to inspect; throws away the entire benefit of the current JSON model for files that are, in practice, tiny. Overkill for a few KB of workspace description. **Do not pursue.**

### Comparison

| | (a) rename alias | (b) versioned container ✅ | (c) binary capsule ❌ |
|---|---|---|---|
| Human-editable / diffable | yes | yes | no |
| Magic header (identifies file) | no | **yes** | yes |
| Schema migrations | no | **yes** (`version`) | yes |
| Backward-compatible with `.json` | yes (same payload) | yes (reader accepts both) | no |
| Implementation cost | minimal | small | large |
| Recommended | as an interim step | **yes** | no |

**Recommendation:** ship **(b)**. It costs little more than (a), is still plain JSON, and buys
the one thing (a) can't: a versioned, migratable, self-identifying format. If you want to land
the extension *today* and the envelope *later*, (a) is a valid stepping stone — accept
`.hyperpanes` now, then layer the `format`/`version` envelope on in a follow-up without
changing the extension again.

## 4. Windows file association (NSIS)

So a double-clicked `*.hyperpanes` opens in the app, register a ProgID and point its
`shell\open\command` at the binary with `"%1"` (the clicked path, delivered as `argv[1]`).

The brief's conceptual mapping is:

```
HKCR\.hyperpanes            (default) = Hyperpanes.Workspace
HKCR\Hyperpanes.Workspace\shell\open\command  (default) = "$INSTDIR\hyperpanes.exe" "%1"
```

**Important — match the per-user installer.** `installer.nsi` is a *per-user* install
(`RequestExecutionLevel user`, everything under **HKCU**, no elevation). The per-user half of
`HKCR` is **`HKCU\Software\Classes`**, so the association must be written there — writing
machine-wide `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`/`HKLM` would require admin and contradict the installer's
design. Snippet to add (using the existing shipped `icon.ico` for the file icon):

```nsis
; ----- .hyperpanes file association (per-user: HKCU\Software\Classes == per-user HKCR) -----
!define WS_EXT    ".hyperpanes"
!define WS_PROGID "Hyperpanes.Workspace"

; --- in Section "Install" (after the binary + icon are in $INSTDIR) ---
  WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_EXT}"   "" "${WS_PROGID}"
  WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_PROGID}" "" "Hyperpanes Workspace"
  WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_PROGID}\DefaultIcon"        "" "$INSTDIR\icon.ico,0"
  WriteRegStr HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_PROGID}\shell\open\command" "" '"$INSTDIR\${MAIN_BINARY}" "%1"'
  ; Tell the shell the association table changed so the icon/verb apply immediately (optional).
  System::Call 'shell32::SHChangeNotify(i 0x08000000, i 0, i 0, i 0)'  ; SHCNE_ASSOCCHANGED

; --- in Section "Uninstall" (mirror the cleanup like the PATH integration does) ---
  DeleteRegKey   HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_PROGID}"
  DeleteRegValue HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_EXT}" ""
  DeleteRegKey /ifempty HKCU "Software\Classes\${WS_EXT}"
  System::Call 'shell32::SHChangeNotify(i 0x08000000, i 0, i 0, i 0)'
```

Notes:
- `${MAIN_BINARY}` is already defined as `hyperpanes.exe` and `icon.ico` is already shipped to
  `$INSTDIR` by the install section — no new files needed.
- `System::Call` uses the `System` plugin bundled with NSIS; the `SHChangeNotify` calls are a
  nicety (refresh icons without a re-login) and can be dropped if you want zero plugin use.
- The quoting idiom (`'"$INSTDIR\..." "%1"'`) matches how `installer.nsi` already quotes paths
  with `$\"`.

## 5. Implementation touch-points (do **not** implement here)

For the recommended **option (b)**, the change surface is small and localized:

1. **`cli/parse.rs`** — widen the positional-path capture (currently `ends_with(".json")`, ~line
   321) to also accept `.hyperpanes`. Without this, a double-clicked `.hyperpanes` arrives as
   `argv[1]` but is **silently ignored** by the parser. Keep accepting `.json`.
2. **GUI argv bootstrap (app crate, seed-from-argv)** — the same extension allow-list applies to
   the GUI's `.json` → `load_workspace` path; widen it to `.hyperpanes` too.
3. **`workspace/io.rs`** — `read_workspace`: detect the envelope (`format == "hyperpanes"`), read
   `version`, and deserialize the inner payload; accept a bare `WorkspaceFile` as legacy
   ("version 0") for backward compat. `write_workspace`: emit the envelope for `.hyperpanes`
   targets (keep emitting bare JSON for `.json`, or migrate writes — your call). Re-assert the
   byte-identical 2-space round-trip for the envelope type. A small `WorkspaceEnvelope { format,
   version, workspace }` serde struct lives naturally next to `WorkspaceFile` in `model.rs`.
4. **`packaging/installer.nsi`** — add the association snippet from §4 to the Install section and
   its cleanup to the Uninstall section.
5. **(later) migrations** — when `version` bumps, add an in-memory upgrade step in `read_workspace`
   between deserialize and return. None needed for v1.

Option (a) is the subset of the above without steps 3 (envelope) and 5 (migrations) — only the
extension allow-lists (1, 2) and the installer association (4).
