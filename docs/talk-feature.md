# Per-pane talk (spoken assistant replies)

A per-pane **Talk** toggle: while it is on, that pane speaks every NEW assistant reply aloud
through a local TTS backend. Off by default, per pane, persisted in the workspace snapshot. The
text comes from the conversation's own transcript (the pane→session marker JSONL), never from
scraping the terminal — so what is spoken is the assistant's actual reply, normalized from
markdown to listenable prose. All panes share ONE serialized speech queue with pane-label
prefixes, a global mute/stop, and an optional focused-pane-only mode.

**Status: BUILT** — core pipeline + control API + GUI + MCP tools; verified end-to-end against
the headless binary (see "Verifying" below). Generalized past Claude-only and Unix-only on
2026-09-01: three transcript formats, four TTS backends across three platforms.

## Which tools can talk, and why not all of them

Talk needs the tool's own record of what it said. Three tools keep one Hyperpanes can bind to a
pane and tail:

| Tool | Pane→session binding | Transcript | Record shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude | `claude-sessions/<paneId>.json` (SessionStart hook) | `<configDir>/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sid>.jsonl` | `{"type":"assistant","message":{"content":[…]}}` |
| cursor-agent | `tool-sessions/cursor-agent/<paneId>.json` (`~/.cursor/hooks.json`) | `~/.cursor/projects/<Encoded-Cwd>/agent-transcripts/<sid>/<sid>.jsonl` | `{"role":"assistant","message":{"content":[…]}}` — no `type` on message records; `type` marks control records like `turn_ended` |
| copilot | `tool-sessions/copilot/<paneId>.json` (`~/.copilot/settings.json`) | `~/.copilot/session-state/<sid>/events.jsonl` | `{"type":"assistant.message","data":{"content":"…"}}` — flat event log |

Every shape above was read off a real install, not off documentation.

A pane running anything else — aider, gemini, goose, codex, a plain shell — resolves to no
transcript and **stays silent**. That is deliberate, not a gap waiting to be filled by reading
the terminal: a terminal carries spinners, progress bars, box drawing and the human's own
echoed keystrokes with no way to tell them from prose, so a scraped tier would make Talk worse,
not better. Adding a tool means adding a hook that writes a pane marker plus a
`TranscriptFormat` arm — nothing else.

## Pipeline

```
pane (talk on)                       core, every 750ms (speech_service::run_ticker)
  └─ resolve_transcript(paneId)      claude marker first, then any hooked tool's marker
       └─ TranscriptRef {path, format}  path + which of the three record shapes to read
            └─ TranscriptTail        byte-cursor tail, starts at EOF (history is never spoken)
                 └─ extract_assistant_text   per-format; tool_use/tool_result dropped
                      └─ normalize_for_speech  markdown → prose (see below)
                           └─ SpeechEngine     ONE global queue, one utterance at a time
                                └─ backend      custom | spd-say | espeak-ng | say | SAPI
```

A pane whose agent exits and restarts points at a different file (or a different tool's
format); the tail notices and re-starts at THAT file's end, so the new conversation's backlog is
not spoken from the top.

```
```

Every stage is core-owned (`rs/crates/core/src/speech/` + `control/speech_service.rs`), spawned
beside the control server — so the GUI app and the headless daemon (`--bin headless`) behave
identically, and the whole feature is testable without audio or a display.

- **Default-off costs nothing**: the engine thread spawns lazily on the first enabled pane, and
  the ticker's no-talkers fast path does no filesystem work at all.
- **Normalization** (`speech/normalize.rs`): fenced code blocks become the phrase
  "code block omitted."; inline code/emphasis/heading/list/table markup is stripped to its text;
  links keep their label (bare URLs become "link"); whitespace collapses; long replies truncate
  at a sentence boundary (~1200 chars) with a spoken "Truncated."
- **Serialization** (`speech/engine.rs`): one utterance plays at a time, FIFO (bounded queue,
  cap 64, drop-oldest). With two or more panes talking, each utterance is prefixed with its
  pane's label ("build. Tests are green."). `stop_all` kills the in-flight backend process
  immediately and discards the backlog; mute is the sticky variant.

## Control API

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `{"type":"setTalk","paneId":…,"enabled":bool}` | toggle a pane's talk; result reports the resolved state + backend (+ a warning when no backend exists) |
| `{"type":"stopSpeech"}` | global one-shot: kill in-flight speech, drop the backlog |
| `{"type":"setSpeechMuted","muted":bool}` | global sticky mute (persisted) |
| `{"type":"setSpeechFocusedOnly","focusedOnly":bool}` | speak only the focused pane (persisted) |

The three global commands are pane-less (handled before window resolution, like `queuePrompt`).
`GET /state` reports `talk: true` on each talking pane and a top-level
`speech: {muted, focusedOnly, backend, speakingPane}` block. The read-model is the single
source of truth: GUI toggles publish into it each tick, control-originated changes reconcile
back onto the GUI (`control_host.rs`), so the two surfaces can never disagree.

## Settings — `<config dir>/speech.json`

A user setting (beside `ai-settings.json`), all fields optional:

```json
{
  "commandTemplate": ["/bin/sh", "/path/to/speak.sh", "{text}"],
  "muted": false,
  "focusedOnly": false
}
```

`commandTemplate` overrides backend auto-detection: an argv array run per utterance WITHOUT a
shell; `{text}` in any element is replaced with the spoken text, and a template with no
`{text}` receives it on stdin. This is also the testing seam — point it at a script that
appends to a file and the whole pipeline is observable headless. **No backend at all** degrades
to a one-time GUI notice + no-op; nothing crashes and the toggle still round-trips.

### Backends (`speech/engine.rs`)

| Platform | Detected backend | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | `spd-say`, else `espeak-ng` | first one on `PATH` wins |
| macOS | `say` | always present |
| Windows | PowerShell `System.Speech` | `Speak` is synchronous, so the process exits when the utterance ends — which is what the queue's one-at-a-time contract needs |

The Windows backend passes the utterance in the environment (`HYPERPANES_SPEECH_TEXT`), never
on the command line: a `-Command` string would have to survive both PowerShell's parser and
Windows' single-string argv, and an assistant reply is arbitrary text. The `PATH` probe is
`PATHEXT`-aware there — `powershell` on disk is `powershell.EXE`.

## GUI

- Pane context menu → **Talk (speak replies)** checkable row; a speaker glyph shows in the
  pane header while talk is on.
- Command palette: **Speech: Stop Now / Mute / Only Focused Pane**.
- One-time toasts: enabling talk with no TTS backend, or while the control server (which hosts
  the speech service) is disabled in Preferences.
- Persistence: `PaneSpec.talk` in the workspace snapshot (`workspace/model.rs`), written by
  `to_session_file`/`to_workspace_file` and restored on relaunch.

## MCP tools (hyperpanes-mcp)

`set_talk {paneId, enabled}`, `set_speech {muted?, focusedOnly?}`, `stop_speech {}` — thin
wrappers over the commands above (`src/control-tools.ts`).

## Verifying

`scripts/talk-demo.sh` boots an ISOLATED headless instance (XDG overrides +
`HYPERPANES_CONTROL_FILE` pinned into the sandbox — the env var otherwise leaks in from a pane
and clobbers the live app's discovery file), fakes two panes' session markers + transcripts,
points `commandTemplate` at an evidence-file writer, and asserts: talk toggles are observable
in `/state`; interleaved appends to two transcripts come out as serialized, pane-labelled,
non-interleaved utterances of normalized prose; pre-existing history is never spoken; and
`stopSpeech` kills an in-flight utterance. Unit coverage lives in `speech/{normalize,engine,
tailer}.rs` and the `setTalk`/`setSpeech*`/`stopSpeech` dispatch tests.
