//! The central app state — Wave-2 **Seam #1**.
//!
//! `State` owns every tab (workspace group), each with its own panes, layout,
//! split sizes, main-fraction, focus and zoom. All mutation flows through the
//! methods here; each one leaves the data consistent and flips `dirty` so the
//! next pump cycle *resyncs* the Slint models (see [`crate::paneview::resync`]).
//! That **mutate → set-dirty → resync** contract is the single seam Wave-2
//! features (palette, keybindings, prefs) extend: they only ever call these
//! methods (usually via a [`crate::command::Command`]) and never touch the UI
//! models directly.

    //! an inference may change how a pane is drawn but must never rewrite `spawn_command`
    //! or the persisted `PaneKind`. Here that rule is structural rather than remembered —
    //! the sniff lives in a runtime-only side map (`State::sniffed_tool`) that nothing
    //! serializes, and the two are combined only in `effective_kind`, which the UI
    //! projection reads. These tests pin both halves of that split.
