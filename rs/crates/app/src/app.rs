//! The multi-window application layer (Phase 4, Wave 1).
//!
//! The Wave-1/3 controller managed exactly one window: one [`State`] == one window's
//! tabs. This module lifts that into an app that owns a **set of windows**, each its own
//! Slint [`AppWindow`] + [`Ui`] model set + [`State`], **all sharing the one central
//! [`SessionManager`]**. Because the manager owns every PTY, a window only references
//! pane `uid`s — so a pane can be re-hosted in any window (replay-primed, no restart).
//!
//! Two things change versus the single-window controller, and only these:
//!   1. **The session event channel is drained centrally** ([`App::tick`]) and each
//!      event is routed to whichever window currently hosts that `uid` — one engine, N
//!      windows. The per-window [`paneview::pump`] no longer touches the channel.
//!   2. **Window-level [`Effect`]s** (new window / re-host / close) are applied against
//!      the window registry here, instead of against a single `AppWindow` in `main`.
//!
//! Everything else — the central [`State`] mutate→resync contract (Seam #1), [`dispatch`]
//! (Seam #2), the overlay slot (Seam #3) — is reused unchanged, per window.
