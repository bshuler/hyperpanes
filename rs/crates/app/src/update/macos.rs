//! macOS apply step for the self-updater (see `mod.rs`). Owned by the Wave-1

//! macOS is **NotifyOnly**: the shared check flow still finds and announces a newer
//! release ("vX available — you have vY"), but instead of downloading an installer the
//! General panel offers "View release", which opens the GitHub releases page with
//! `open` (via `core::paths::os_open`, wired in `app.rs`'s pref-action 19/20 handlers
//! behind [`super::apply_strategy`]).
//
// Future self-update hook (don't wire `launch_installer` until it lands):
//  - .app swap: download the .dmg/.zip, verify, swap the bundle next to the running one
//    and relaunch (Sparkle-style). Needs codesigning + notarization first — an unsigned
//    swapped bundle would trip Gatekeeper harder than a fresh download does.
