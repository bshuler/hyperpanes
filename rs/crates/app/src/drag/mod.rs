//! Drag / tear-off — the app's signature interaction (Phase 4, Wave 2).
//!
//! This module owns the **global-cursor drag pump** (lifted from `spike-tearoff`) and
//! the pure geometry used to resolve a drop. The pump does *not* lean on Slint pointer
//! delivery (which is per-window and loses the grab the instant the cursor crosses into
//! another window — exactly what tear-off needs). Instead a drag is *started* by a Slint
//! pointer-down (on a pane header or a tab), and from then on the whole gesture is driven
//! from **global Win32 state** read every 8 ms by [`crate::app::App::tick`]:
//!   * `GetCursorPos`     → screen-global cursor (Slint has no global-cursor API);
//!   * `GetAsyncKeyState` → left-button-still-down / released (drag end);
//!   * `GetWindowRect`    → hit-test the cursor against each window's screen rect.
//!
//! Once the cursor leaves the source window a transparent / click-through / topmost
//! **ghost** (a pure Win32 layered window, kept out of Slint's render path) chases the
//! cursor. On release the drop is resolved against the window under the cursor:
//!   * over another window's **pane area** → *stitch* the pane in at the hovered slot;
//!   * over another window's **tab strip**  → *dock* the pane as a new tab;
//!   * over **empty space**                → a *new window* hosting the pane.
//! A drop back inside the source window **reorders** (pane → slot, tab → strip position).
//!
//! `State` is never mutated mid-drag; the source pane/tab stays put and the ghost+preview
//! provide the live feedback. The detach→adopt (replay-primed, no PTY restart) happens
//! only on release, so a cancelled drag costs nothing.

/// Movement past this many **physical** px (from the press point) promotes a pending
/// press into a real drag — below it, the gesture is just a click (focus / select).
