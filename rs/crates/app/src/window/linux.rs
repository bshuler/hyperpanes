//! Linux implementation of the window-chrome surface (see `mod.rs` for the frozen
//! signatures). Unlike Win32 there is no OS-global window handle that can drive chrome
//! operations on its own — on Wayland *everything* (move-drag, minimize, maximize,
//! fullscreen, decorations) must go through the compositor via the window's own
//! `xdg_toplevel`, which winit owns. So this file routes every op through the
//! `winit::window::Window` behind the Slint window, obtained once via the
//! `slint::winit_030` accessor and kept in a registry keyed by the value we hand out as
//! `raw`:
//!
//! * `raw` encodes the winit window's allocation address (`Weak::as_ptr as isize`) —
//!   unique, stable for the window's lifetime, and nonzero, which is all callers rely on.
//! * The registry stores `Weak` references so a closed window's native handle is not kept
//!   alive by us; a dead entry degrades every op to the contractual "0 = no-op".
//!
//! The same registry also feeds the drag seam (`drag/linux.rs`): the winit event hook
//! installed here tracks the last in-window pointer position + primary-button state,
//! which is the *only* pointer source available on Wayland (no global pointer exists).
//! Works on both backends; X11-only extras (true global pointer, the tear-off ghost)
//! live in `drag/linux.rs`.
