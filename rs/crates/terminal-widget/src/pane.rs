//! [`TerminalPane`] — the reusable Rust controller for one terminal pane.
//!
//! It owns the renderer-agnostic grid model ([`TermGrid`]) and a chosen [`PaneRenderer`]
//! (software or GPU), and exposes a small, Wave-2-friendly API. It is deliberately
//! **decoupled from the session transport**: the caller pumps it.
//!
//! ## Lifecycle (how the app-shell drives N of these)
//! 1. Spawn/attach a session in `hyperpanes_core::session_manager` sized to your initial
//!    `cols`×`rows`, and construct a `TerminalPane` of the same size.
//! 2. On each `SessionEvent::Data { data, .. }` for this pane → [`feed`](Self::feed), then
//!    drain [`take_replies`](Self::take_replies) and `SessionManager::write` them back
//!    (DSR/DA answers — the shell hangs without them).
//! 3. On a Slint key event → [`crate::keys::encode_key`] → `SessionManager::write`.
//! 4. On a geometry change → compute new `cols`×`rows` from the pixel size and the font
//!    cell metrics, [`resize`](Self::resize) the pane, and `SessionManager::resize` the
//!    session if it returns `true`.
//! 5. Each frame (a Slint `Timer`): if [`take_dirty`](Self::take_dirty) (or the cursor
//!    blink flipped) → [`render`](Self::render) and hand the `slint::Image` to your model.
//!
//! The `Font` is passed in at render time so a whole fleet of panes can share one glyph
//! cache (it is `&mut` because rasterization is lazy/cached).
