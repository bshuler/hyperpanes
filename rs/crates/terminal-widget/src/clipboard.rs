//! A tiny wrapper over the system clipboard ([`arboard`]) for copy-on-select and
//! right-click paste — the OS-clipboard half of the Electron `navigator.clipboard` calls in
//! `Terminal.tsx`.
//!
//! `arboard`'s `Clipboard` holds a live platform connection, so we keep one open for the
//! pane's lifetime (re-opening per copy is slow and, on X11, loses ownership). On Windows the
//! handle is a unit value: arboard opens the OS clipboard *per operation* (with retries), so a
//! kept handle can never serve a stale read — verified against arboard 3.6.1 for #9. Every call is
//! best-effort: clipboard access can transiently fail (another app holding it, a headless
//! session), and — exactly like the Electron `.catch(() => {})` — we never want that to take
//! the pane down. Failures degrade to "nothing happened".

/// An owned handle to the system clipboard. One per pane; cheap to keep around.
