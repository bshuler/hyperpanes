//! Port of the PTY layer in `src/main/session.ts` — a [`Pty`] trait + a `portable-pty`
//! implementation (conpty on Windows): spawn(file, args, cwd, env, cols, rows) → a
//! handle exposing onData / onExit (via an event sink), write, resize, kill.
//!
//! The backend is kept behind the trait so the conpty implementation is swappable
//! (e.g. the `portable-pty-psmux` fork adds modern conpty input-mode flags if the
//! default path mis-delivers `submit` / `send_keys`).
//!
//! ## Event delivery
//! `portable-pty` reads are blocking, so [`spawn_pty`] starts one OS thread that
//! drains the master reader and pushes [`PtyEvent`]s into a caller-supplied sink. The
//! sink is a plain `Fn` (not a tokio channel) so this module stays runtime-agnostic;
//! `session_manager` wraps an `UnboundedSender` in a closure. When the reader hits EOF
//! the thread waits on the child and emits a final [`PtyEvent::Exit`] with its code.
//!
//! ## Smoke test
//! A real-shell round-trip lives in `tests` behind `#[ignore]` (it spawns a process).
//! Run it explicitly with:
//! `cargo test --manifest-path rs/Cargo.toml -p hyperpanes-core session::pty -- --ignored --nocapture`
//!
//! ### Environment note (verified 2026-06-07; root-caused 2026-06-09)
//! ConPTY (spawned with `PSUEDOCONSOLE_INHERIT_CURSOR`, as portable-pty does) sends an
//! initial cursor-position query (`ESC [ 6 n`) to the master and emits NOTHING until
//! the terminal replies with a cursor position report (`ESC [ row ; col R`). A real
//! terminal answers automatically, which is why panes work; a raw test harness that
//! only reads will wait forever — in any session, interactive or not (this was
//! misdiagnosed as a headless-session property). A harness that answers the query
//! streams fine even in a sandboxed session — see `rs/spikes/conpty-probe`, which does
//! exactly that (and note: drop the master BEFORE joining a reader thread, or the
//! reader never sees EOF). The `#[ignore]`d smoke tests could be made headless-capable
//! the same way. The session engine's own logic is covered deterministically by the
//! `session_manager` pipeline + mock-pty tests, which need no pty at all.
