//! The **session daemon** (`docs/session-daemon-plan.md` M0) — a long-lived,
//! PTY-owning process that survives a GUI crash. The GUI becomes a *client* that
//! attaches over a framed Unix-domain socket (Windows: named pipe — M3); the daemon
//! owns a [`SessionRegistry`] and multiplexes its event stream to every attached client.
//! Entirely in `core` (no Slint), so the whole thing is headless-testable.
//!
//! ## Transport & blocking I/O
//! The wire framing ([`session::proto`](crate::session::proto)) is plain blocking
//! `Read`/`Write`, so the daemon serves each connection on its own OS thread with blocking
//! `std::os::unix::net` sockets — no async-framing layer, and it composes with the
//! blocking [`DaemonClient`] reader thread the test (and future M1) use. The accept loop
//! and the event-broadcast pump each run on a thread too. The registry's per-session pty
//! *driver* tasks still need a Tokio runtime (`SessionRegistry::create` spawns them), so
//! [`run`] builds one and the registry is created inside it.
//!
//! ## Event multiplexing
//! Every session event from the registry arrives on one mpsc receiver; a pump thread
//! rebroadcasts each event over a [`tokio::sync::broadcast`] channel. Each connection
//! subscribes and forwards the events for the uids it has `Attach`ed to. Multiple clients
//! may attach to the same (or different) sessions concurrently.
//!
//! ## Discovery / single-daemon-per-salt
//! Reuses the `single_instance` machinery's shape: a flock'd `hyperpanesd-<salt>.lock`
//! plus a `hyperpanesd-<salt>.sock`, both under the per-user runtime dir, with the salt
//! hashed to a fixed-width token. The flock guarantees one daemon per salt; a second
//! `run` for a salt already served exits cleanly (`AddrInUse`).
//!
//! M0 scope: bind + accept + handle create/write/resize/kill/kill_all, stream events,
//! serve ListSessions / Attach(replay) / RenderScreen, plus a loopback [`DaemonClient`].
//!
//! ## M3 lifecycle hardening
//! Three new behaviors layer on top of the M0 serve loop, all coordinated through a small
//! shared [`Lifecycle`] (an atomic connection counter + a shutdown flag + the listening
//! socket path, so the exit path can unlink it):
//!
//! * **Idle-exit.** A monitor thread arms a [grace timer](idle_grace) once the daemon has
//!   **0 live sessions AND 0 connected clients**, and exits the process when the grace
//!   elapses while still idle. Any client connect (the connection counter) or session
//!   create (the registry's live count) resets it — so the daemon lingers across a GUI
//!   crash→relaunch gap but never forever. The grace is overridable via
//!   `HYPERPANES_DAEMON_IDLE_MS` so tests can use a short one.
//! * **`Shutdown`.** [`ClientMsg::Shutdown`] kills every session and exits cleanly
//!   (releasing the flock on process death, unlinking the socket on the way out). Drives
//!   the app's `--kill-daemon` and the quit-vs-keep-alive "OFF" branch.
//! * **Robust discovery/teardown.** Startup reaps a stale lock/socket (the flock gates, a
//!   leftover socket from a dead daemon is removed); the runtime dir is created `0700` and
//!   the socket tightened to `0600`.
//!
//! Everything above describes the **unix** daemon, which is this module. Windows serves the
//! same protocol over a named pipe from [`windows`](self::windows), and [`run`]/[`kill_daemon`]
//! dispatch there — but its live-upgrade story differs in kind, because a ConPTY's `HPCON` is
//! an opaque per-process handle that no documented API can hand to another process. So instead
//! of *moving* the terminals on upgrade (the unix `SCM_RIGHTS` fd handoff below), Windows never
//! moves them at all: the ConPTYs live in a **pty-host** process that outlives daemon upgrades,
//! and a takeover is the successor re-attaching to that same host. See [`windows`] for the
//! design; the two legs share the wire protocol, the client and every call site.
