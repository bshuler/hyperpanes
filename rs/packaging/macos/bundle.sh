# Hyperpanes — macOS .app bundle + .dmg packaging (track T6 packaging-macos).
#
# Contract (docs/ports-seams.md §3, frozen — release-rust.yml calls this blind):
#   rs/packaging/macos/bundle.sh <version>   # <version> WITHOUT a leading "v"
#   -> rs/packaging/out/hyperpanes-<version>.dmg
# Runs from any cwd (resolves the repo root from its own location), exits
# non-zero on any failure, puts ALL artifacts under rs/packaging/out/.
#
# Must work both on the Mac mini and on a GitHub macos-latest (arm64) runner:
# only stock tools are used (cargo, sips, iconutil, hdiutil, plutil, codesign).
#
# Signing and notarization are both opt-in through the environment, and both
# degrade to a warning rather than a failure, so this stays runnable on a machine
# with no certificate at all:
#
#   HYPERPANES_SIGN_ID        codesign identity. Defaults to the first
#                             "Developer ID Application" in the login keychain,
#                             then to ad-hoc ("-") with a warning.
#   HYPERPANES_NOTARY_PROFILE `xcrun notarytool store-credentials` profile name.
#                             Unset -> notarization is skipped.
#
# An ad-hoc signature is not nothing: it is what lets macOS attach TCC grants to
# the app at all. It just changes on every rebuild, so the grants do too — which
# is exactly the problem a real Developer ID solves.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- code signing
# Identity resolution, in order: the environment, then the login keychain, then
# ad-hoc. Only the identity NAME is ever printed — it is not a secret, but the
# key behind it is, and nothing here reads, prompts for, or writes one. Signing
# happens entirely through the keychain, which is where the key stays.
#
# entitlements.plist carries no XML comments because AMFI, the parser codesign
# hands it to, rejects them outright ("syntax error near line 4"), so the reasons
# for its two keys live here instead.
#
# Both are hardened-runtime gates that close *before* TCC gets to ask. Without
# them macOS refuses the microphone and Apple events outright and the user never
# sees a dialog to say yes to; with them the user is still asked and still free
# to say no. They are the packaging half of core::permissions::Right::Microphone
# and Right::Automation.
#
# Deliberately absent: `allow-jit` and `allow-unsigned-executable-memory` —
# nothing in this build generates code at runtime (Metal via wgpu, the bundled
# SQLite amalgamation, no scripting engine), and turning off W^X in a process
# that hosts the user's shells needs a better reason than "just in case".
# `disable-library-validation` — the binary is statically linked and loads no
# dylibs of its own. `app-sandbox` — Hyperpanes runs the user's shells and opens
# the user's repositories, which is the opposite of a container; Full Disk Access
# is a grant the user makes in Settings, not an entitlement we can claim.
